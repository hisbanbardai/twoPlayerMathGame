# Two-Player Math Game

A game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life. Whoever loses all their lives first loses and the other player wins.
